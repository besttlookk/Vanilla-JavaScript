    <!-- The actions to which JavaScript can respond are called events -->

                         <!-- Event Handler -->
    <!-- An Event handler is javaScript code associated with a particular part of the documnet and a particular event.
    A handler is executed if and when the given event occurs at the part of the document to whcih it is asscoicated -->

                         <!-- Event binding with HTML Attributes (old method) (can be used for small perpose)-->
    <!-- js ka code nahi hota --> 
    <!-- onClick/ ondbClick/ onblur -->


                        <!-- Event Binding with javaScript -->
<!-- When we use this approch we can add or remove handlers dynamically as well as it improves the sepration between the structure of document and its logic and presentation -->

                    <!-- Event handler overwriting -->
<!-- if we bind same element with two events ..last binking will overwrite the above one -->
